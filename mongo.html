    MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. Released in February 2009 by 10gen (now MongoDB Inc.), it supports features like sharding, replication, and ACID transactions (from version 4.0). MongoDB Atlas, its managed cloud service, operates on AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. Current versions are licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL). MongoDB is a member of the MACH Alliance.

Background
As of May 2025, MongoDB was the fifth most popular database software.[10][11] It focuses mostly on managing large databases of unstructured, "messy" data.[12][13] It's typically used for mobile and web apps that commonly use unstructured databases.[14] As of 2024, there were 50,000 MongoDB customers.[14] MongoDB was originally best known as a NoSQL database product.[15] The company released a database as-a-service product called Atlas in 2016[16] that became 70 percent of MongoDB's revenue by 2024.[14] Over time, MongoDB added analytics, transactional databases,[17] encryption,[18] vector databases,[14] ACID, migration features, and other enterprise tools.[19] Initially, the MongoDB software was free and open source[16] under the AGPL license. MongoDB adopted an SSPL (server side public license) for future releases starting in 2018.[14][20]
